### YouTube Videos

There is a YouTube video available of me giving this material at the
[Gaussian Process Road Show in Uganda](http://gpss.cc/gprs13/). The first 25 minutes of the relevant video covers model selection, and then it leads into the video second below which
introduces Bayesian modelling.
